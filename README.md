# GTP

The Go Text Protocol is the standard for communicating with a Go engine.
This library aims to implement the client-facing portion of the protocol - for querying and instructing an engine.

# GTP/Haskell

The file 'Protocol.hs' is the intended public-facing API for this package.
There's a lot of work left on this.
